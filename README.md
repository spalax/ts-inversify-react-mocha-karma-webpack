Inside i have configured:

* TypeScript - because i like OOP idea in JS.
* TSLinter - just because the code must be consistent, so somebody should watch it.
* InversifyJS - because of Uncle BOB and ~~SOLI~~(D)
* ReactJS - i like the idea of standalone components SRP like components.
* TypedCssModules - it is a implementation of CSS classes as typed modules for React components. So you do not need 
* Webpack - just because it is too simple to run everything.
* PostCSS - for processing styles

Unit Testing: (Ofcourse i configured testing environment as well)
Thanks for: @fay_jai and his [starting guide](https://medium.com/@fay_jai/getting-started-on-testing-with-typescript-reactjs-and-webpack-a45a72f4f603#.nlzwt4a5k"), it was really helpful.  

* Mocha - as a test framework
* Karma - as test runner
* Sinon - for stubs, mocks and other..
* Chai - as assertion lib
